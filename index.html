				<h2> Description</h2>
				<h3> Personal life 🌍 </h3>
				<p> I'm French-Nigerian-Lebanese and I come from Niger. I've lived in this country since I was a little girl. I used to go to a French lycée in Niamey, and this year I joined Essec in Cergy. It's a big life change for me, but I've adapted to it and I'm delighted to have been accepted at this school. 
				</p>
				<h3> My personality 💐</h3>
				<p> I'm open-minded, considerate and friendly. I'm dynamic and motivated in everything I do. I am said to be meticulous and diligent. My values are my family, my financial stability and my well-being.

				<h2> My hobbies</h2>

				<h3> Volley-ball 🏐 </h3>
				<p> I'm passionate about volleyball. I've been playing the sport for over 4 years. I was captain of a team in 2018. We took part in an international beach volleyball tournament in Morocco, and came 4th in the standings.
				</p>
				<h3> Drawing ✍🏼 </h3>
				<p> I've been drawing since I was very young. I used to take drawing lessons, but unfortunately I stopped when my drawing teacher left Niger. Since then, I've continued to draw at home. I mainly draw lions, a symbolic animal that represents me well.
